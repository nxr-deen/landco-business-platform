# Contributing to LandCo

We love your input! We want to make contributing to LandCo as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Requests

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the documentation with details of any API changes
3. The PR should work for all configured CI environments
4. PRs should target the `main` branch

## Coding Style

* Use the existing code style as a guide
* Run linting before submitting your code
* Write tests for new functionality
